### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. jQuery enables developers to implement common JavaScript tasks with minimal code
2. All jQuery code conforms to JavaScript rules and uses shortcuts that can look like different language
3. Every jQuery statement begins with $ which specifies that any code that follows should be interpreted using jQuery library
